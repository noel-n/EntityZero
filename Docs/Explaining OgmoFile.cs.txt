Explaining OgmoFile.cs

I put a bunch of classes in this one file because I didn't want to be making different files
each time I wanted a new class. It represents one Ogmo JSON File and it parses that file
into  data we can use.

If you watched Alex's OGMO video he did something similar, I super recommend that you check it out:

If you haven't parsed JSON with c# before then there are basically 2 options, System.Text.Json and 
Newtonsoft.Json. I used System.Text.Json cuz it's apperently faster. If you wanna understand the code in this file
even though you don't really need to then you can read this article which was like super helpful:

OK! now I'm gonna explain how to use an Ogmo file and this class to put your level in a game. 
First you create an instance of OgmoFile and supply the level's filename and then you can access all the data 
in the JSON. 

If you needed the data2D array from a Tile Layer in Ogmo what you would do is something like
myOgmoFile.gridLayers[0].data2D. I admit it that it kind of sucks to have to get a layer by index but I'll 
think of a better way later.
